# Pumpkin Patch Business Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates the financial performance of a hypothetical pumpkin patch business, comparing two different revenue models. The goal is to determine which model yields higher profitability by analyzing various business factors such as production, pricing, labor costs, and customer behavior. 
(I have included a powerpoint that explains the project in futher details)

## Revenue Models
- **Model 1: Price Per Pound:** Customers are charged based on the weight of the pumpkins they select.
- **Model 2: Flat Fee:** Customers pay a flat entry fee, which includes a free pumpkin of their choice.

## Key Factors Analyzed
- **Pumpkin Production:** Monthly production rates, including seasonal variations.
- **Pricing:** Price per pound for Model 1 and flat fee per entry for Model 2.
- **Labor Costs:** Expenses related to staffing, including hourly wages and the number of employees.
- **Spoilage Rate:** Percentage of pumpkins that spoil before being sold.
- **Alternative Revenue Streams:** Other possible income sources, such as concessions or events.

## Analytical Approach
- **Simulations:** Conducted 1,000 simulations for each revenue model to gather data and ensure the accuracy of financial projections.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated means, 95% Confidence Intervals, and total profits for both revenue models to compare profitability under different conditions.
- **Visualizations:** Created line graphs to display the profitability trends of each model over time and under various scenarios.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel:** Used for data entry, simulations, and analysis. Functions like `RAND()`, `SUMPRODUCT()`, and `IF()` were employed to simulate different business scenarios.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Basic statistical tools within Excel, such as mean and confidence interval calculations, were used to interpret the simulation results.

## Findings
- **Profitability Comparison:** The analysis revealed which revenue model is more profitable under specific conditions, considering factors like pumpkin size, customer traffic, and spoilage rate.
- **Decision-Making Insights:** Provided actionable insights to help the hypothetical business decide which pricing strategy to implement.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of strategic decision-making in business operations by simulating real-world scenarios and analyzing their financial outcomes. By comparing different revenue models, the simulation provides valuable insights that can guide pricing strategies and improve profitability in a seasonal business like a pumpkin patch.
